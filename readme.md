## Debugging reminders

* to debug in windows in virtualbox env, download mesa opengl32.dll from https://downloads.fdossena.com/Projects/Mesa3D/Builds/MesaForWindows-x64-20.1.8.7z
* make sure you put rtaudiod.dll in the build folder's root otherwise audio sink will not load.
* use system monitor to debug missing dlls while they fail to load.

Good luck.
